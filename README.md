# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.

A brief, one-sentence description of the project.

## About the Project

This project serves as a foundational exercise for mastering the core principles of modern web development. You'll build a structured, component-based application from scratch, focusing on Next.js's Pages Router. The main purpose is to guide you through a complete development cycle from scaffolding the project and setting up your environment to implementing interactive UI elements and fetching data from an external API. This hands-on approach helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring you're comfortable with the tools and best practices used in the industry today.



## Features

* **Component-Driven UI**: The application is built with a library of reusable, modular components like `Card`, `Button`, and `PostCard`. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability, allowing for consistent UI across the application.

* **Dynamic Routing**: It uses Next.js's `Pages Router` to handle navigation between different parts of the application, including dedicated pages for the home screen, user profiles, and posts.

* **API Integration**: The project demonstrates how to fetch and display data from external APIs (specifically, `JSONPlaceholder`), showcasing practical data-fetching patterns within a Next.js application.

* **Type Safety with TypeScript**: By using TypeScript and defining clear interfaces for props and data structures, the project ensures a robust and error-free codebase, making it easier to scale and maintain

* **Responsive Design**: The entire application is styled using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that makes it simple to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing layouts without writing custom CSS.
